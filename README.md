# calc-app

##In progress

make a simple calculator app using React.js.

This calculator will show what is keyed in, including the symbols / * + = so that the user can see what they have entered before the current key press.

Once the = sign is clicked, it will show '=' in the display but also the solution.

After that, any key presses will clear the display and they user can begin again.
